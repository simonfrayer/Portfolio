I have successfully finished 2 projects (single user and client/server systems) that me and my team worked on during our school semesters. Apart from that I have put together a new team of colleges with whom we are currently designing and implementing a website for our customer - A building with apartments for rent. I am a quick learner and determined to achieve my goals. I have no problem with learning new technologies for example for my website project I had to learn to use Vue.js and Tailwind CSS on my own. I also did an on side course about Python during my highs school education. "
